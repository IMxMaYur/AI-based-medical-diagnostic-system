🚀 AI-Based Medical Diagnostics System – Transforming Healthcare with AI! 🏥

Proud to share my latest project – an AI-powered Medical Diagnostics System that leverages deep learning to assist in early disease detection and diagnosis. This innovative system enables users to upload medical images (X-rays, MRI scans, etc.), providing fast and accurate predictions with actionable insights.

🔥 Key Features:

✅ AI-Powered Disease Detection – Uses TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
✅ User-Friendly Web Interface – Built with Flask & React.js for seamless interaction.
✅ Fast & Reliable Predictions – Optimized model for high accuracy and efficiency.
✅ Cloud-Based Deployment – Scalable and accessible anytime, anywhere.
✅ Real-Time Recommendations – Provides treatment suggestions based on AI analysis.

🛠 Tech Stack:

🔹 AI/ML: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
🔹 Backend: Flask (Python)
🔹 Frontend: React.js
🔹 Database: SQLite / Firebase

This project demonstrates the power of AI in revolutionizing healthcare, making diagnostics more accessible, faster, and accurate. Excited to explore more possibilities in AI-driven healthcare solutions!

Let’s connect and discuss how AI can shape the future of medical technology! 💡
